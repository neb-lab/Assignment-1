<h2>MY PROFILE</h2>


<h3>Your Interest In I.T</h3>

<p>My interest in I.T began in the 90s in school. After completing high school, I never bothered with I.T until about 5 years ago when I started work as an energy rater. Since using the computer every day and working remotely I thought it would be a good idea to study I.T further.
I searched online for introduction courses to I.T and found this one offered by RMIT. After graduating from this course, I intend to enrol in an introduction to computer programming. If I complete that and I’m happy with the study work load then I will enrol in a bachelor of information technology.
</p>



<h3>Personal Information</h3>

<p>Background Information: I’m a Victorian male and I work in the residential construction sector doing energy ratings. I have a construction background, carpentry, concreting. I’m Australian and I speak English and Serbian. I have completed high school and a diploma in building surveying. I enjoy spending time with my wife and my family. I enjoy travelling and working remotely. I’ve been working 100% remotely, even before covid and it’s great.</p>



<h3>Ideal Job</h3>

<p>Java Software Engineer</p>
<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/58313256?type=standout#sol=451c2ada3d5a88ecc130afc55be941f1f9a1a20e</p>

<p>The position is for a Java Software Engineer. They are looking for several software engineers with different levels of experience to work on their new platform doing green field projects. The successful applicant will be involved in the validation and selection of technologies to enable blockchain assets and experiences. They are a fully remote team distributed around the globe.
What makes this position appealing to me is that its fully remote work as that’s how I have been working for the last 5 years. Honestly, I’m not looking for work after the completion of this course. I have a job that I intend to keep doing. This is just for fun and personal development. 

The skills, qualifications and experience required for this job are:
-	4 – 8 Years of Java development experience within a product organisation or start up environment
-	You need to be a technology expert and to love to experiment with new technologies
-	You also need to be an excellent communicator and have full working rights in Australia.

The skills, qualifications and experience I currently have applying to this job are pretty much nil. I use my laptop to use a program called FR5 to do energy ratings for new homes. It’s a simple program. I also use a word template to write up a summary report after each job. I use a excel template to invoice. I use the internet to browse for info and outlook to receive and send back completed jobs. That’s all the experience in info tech I have. To obtain the skills, qualifications and experience to get this job firstly I would need to continue studying beyond this introduction course. I would need to pursue a bachelor of Information Technology but Ideally a bachelor in computer science. Then find a job and get the 4 – 8 years’ experience.

<h3>Personal Profile</h3>

<p>The results of my Myers – Briggs test is Architect. Personality – INTJ-A / INTJ-T</p>
<p>For the online learning test, I just typed ‘Online learning test’ in google and chose 
the driver knowledge test which I scored 95% on.
</p>
<p>I did a big 5 personality test for the third one. I scored:</p>
<p>Openness – 96%</p>
<p>Conscientiousness – 58%</p>
<p>Extraversion – 46%</p>
<p>Agreeableness - 71%</p>
<p>Neuroticism – 10%</p>



<h4>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4>
<p>The Myers – Briggs test I would say is pretty accurate, these results don’t really mean anything to me. I will just keep being me and doing what I need to. 
The second test I did a driver knowledge test which appeared in a google search of “online learning test”. The test results mean for me that I have still remembered the road rules since starting driving in 2001. This type of test would be good to do every 5 years or so just to make sure you still remember the rules.
The third test was a big 5 personality test. This one also I found was fairly accurate. The results are not a surprise and don’t mean anything to me. 
</p>



<h4>How do you think these results will influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>
<p>These results will not influence my behaviour in a team. In my work history I have worked as part of a team many times, in many different places and many different roles. I prefer to work alone but I don’t mind working in teams. I just don’t like doing team work online because of the communication aspect. I like verbal face to face communication, but It’s something I need to get used to moving forward into the future. I work well in a team, I will do what is required and help others if I can. I communicate well. I don’t like leadership roles not because I can’t do it, it’s because I don’t want the headache that comes with it unless I’m being paid enough. Leadership roles would also make you take your work home and I don’t like that unless the pay is good.</p>



<h4>How should you take this in account when forming a team?</h4>
<p>When forming a team with people I can see or talk to in person I will look for people that will be punctual and reliable and that will also work well with others. If it’s a team online like this for school then I don’t really mind just put me in whichever team you like. If I am being part of a team then I will just do my job what is required and help others out if I can. I work well with all types of people. I have never had any work clashes with people, for me work is just a job it’s not who I am.</p>



<h3>Project Idea</h3>


<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>I have based my idea around fresh produce because I worked in market gardens as a kid and also at a distribution centre for an Australian supermarket retailer. A system or software which collects data about a product and then stores it so it can be viewed by anyone along the supply chain. For example: a market gardener harvests produce and attaches information or data to the product as it goes along the supply chain for later viewing by the customer. Then the customer can scan the final product with their phone in the supermarket and it would bring up all of the information about the produce and its journey to you. </p>



<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>Something like this would be useful to people who are buying the product. The consumer. You could scan the produce at the shops and make a decision if you wanted to buy it. You would know if its fresh and how far its travelled before getting to you. This would also force the suppliers to lift their game in terms of quality and freshness because everything would be visible. It would also be useful in helping prevent food poisoning or similar. You would not buy and eat something if you knew that it was supposed to be refrigerated but it sat in the sun on a pallet for 2 hours.</p>



<h4>Description</h4>
<p>In the case of fresh produce and market gardens, there would be sensors attached to various farm equipment and machinery that the farming operation is using. The sensors would not need to be very large and would collect data from the outside world. Data like air temperature, moisture and humidity, if its sunny or cloudy etc. The workers in the fields would pick the produce and then pack it in boxes. Once its packed they could create a receipt and stick it onto the box. The receipt could include a barcode, QR code or something similar. In the QR code or barcode there would be information which could be viewed by the person who scans into it. The information would be all of the data that the sensors have collected along with the date, time and location the produce was harvested. </p>

<p>Once the produce was packed into boxes and the barcode sticker attached then it would be moved into chillers on the farm. There could also be sensors in the chiller that would record the time the produce was placed inside and what the temperature of the produce was at that time. This data could then be added to the original barcode that’s stuck onto the box. Then after the produce has been stored in the chillers it would be loaded onto trucks and taken to a market in the city or it would be taken directly to a distribution centre for Coles or Safeway. At the time that the pallets of produce are loaded onto trucks there would also me information inputted onto the barcode. Either automatically with sensors collecting data or manually. The information would include the time, date, temperature and anything else that could be important.</p>

<p>Once the produce reaches the distribution centre or the fruit and vegetable markets and unloaded there would also there would also be sensors detecting temperatures and times and that information would be stored on the QR code or barcode. Once the produce is moved from the distribution centre or the markets information would also be recorded.</p>

<p>Finally, upon reaching the store and the final destination from its journey from the farm the produce would be displayed and ready for sale. The customer would be able to come along then and scan the barcode that corresponds to the produce. Once they scan the QR code or barcode they would be able to bring up the whole journey of that produce from the time it was picked to current. They would be able to see how long it’s been since it was harvested. You could see the different changes in temperature throughout the journey. (Not so important with fruit and vegetables but for something like milk and meat it would be good to know). You could also see the distance it has travelled before it got to you. So now the customer has all of this knowledge and they can make a better decision for themselves if the product is worth buying or not.</p>



<h4>Tools And Technologies</h4>
<p>I’m not sure of the software needed for this. I don’t have any experience with software I didn’t know what Git-Hub was until last week. The system would need to be operating live but could also be a closed type system which is updated manually by everyone along the chain and then refreshed. 
The hardware would be small sensors placed on machinery or work stations that collect data automatically and also can have data inputted manually. A scanning device would also be needed along the supply chain to scan into tickets and add information. The consumer would just need their smartphone. 
</p>



<h4>Skills Required</h4>
<p>The skills required for the project would require a person or people to write software for this to run. They could work on the project on Git-Hub. There would not be any special hardware apart from the sensors, scanners and printers but I could be wrong I’m not a tech guy. I’m not sure how feasible it is to find the skills to make the software but computer scientists would not be cheap. You Would also need someone to market this product and find customers willing to use it.</p>



<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>If the project is successful, it would allow people to make better choices when buying food or other items. Better choices in terms of their health and budget. If used for food it would minimise food wastage also because products that are not good would not sell, which would mean they would sit on the shelves for longer and then after being thrown away the store would order less next time. You could also see how far the produce travels to get to you and the carbon footprint also if you wanted to attach that to the QR code.
